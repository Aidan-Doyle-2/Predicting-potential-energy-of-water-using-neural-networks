# Predicting-potential-energy-of-water-using-neural-networks
Trained a neural network potential to predict total molecular energies of water from atomic coordinates. Combined rotated and unrotated datasets, scaled features, and optimized a Keras model to achieve low MAE and MSE for H2O energy prediction.
